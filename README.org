* org-remoteimg
Display remote inline images in org-mode with automatic caching.

** About
This package displays remote images inline in org-mode with automatic caching. The next time you visit the file or fetch the image, it will be instantly fetched from the cache.

This feature is present in Doom Emacs, and when I switched to GNU emacs, I found that I was quite fond of that feature, so I made it here. You can finally do ~[[https://gaodean.me/gen/cat.jpg]]~, and have it display inline just like local images. The code here is adapted from the Doom Emacs codebase, and I just thought to make a small plugin to make it simpler to use for GNU emacs users.

(this image would display in emacs with the plugin enabled)

** Install
*** use-package
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package org-remoteimg
    :straight (org-remoteimg :type git :host github :repo "gaoDean/org-remoteimg"))
#+end_src

*** Manual
#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/plugin/")
  (require 'org-remoteimg)
#+end_src

** Caching
After the install, remember to do:
#+begin_src elisp
  ;; optional: set this to wherever you want the cache to be stored
  ;; (setq url-cache-directory "~/.cache/emacs/url")

  (setq org-display-remote-inline-images 'cache) ;; enable caching

  ;; or this if you don't want caching
  ;; (setq org-display-remote-inline-images 'download)

  ;; or this if you want to disable this plugin
  ;; (setq org-display-remote-inline-images 'skip)
#+end_src

By default, this plugin will only cache images. If you want to cache any web request, just do:
#+begin_src elisp
;; this is a emacs built-in feature
(setq url-automatic-caching t)
#+end_src

** Other
+ This plugin works quite well with [[https://github.com/gaoDean/org-imgtog][org-imgtog]]. Remember to setup caching if you want to use it though, otherwise you'll have a bad time.
